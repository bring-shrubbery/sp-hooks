# Zod Search Params State

![approximate implementation preview](./assets/estimated-implementation.png)

## Features

- 🚀 `useState` hook that syncs the state with url search params.
- ⚡️ Search params are validated using Zod, so only the validated properties and values are used.
- 🤓 Removes search params set to default value, to avoid unnecessary query string length.
- 😳 Use it with Next.js or any other React project.
