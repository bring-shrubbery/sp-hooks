## Getting Started

### Step 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è

Before we start, don't forget to star this repo and follow [@bring-shrubbery](https://github.com/bring-shrubbery), thanks!

### Next.js

`pnpm add @sp-hooks/next`

### React.js

`pnpm add @sp-hooks/react`

## Examples

### Simple Next.js usage

Following example will render a button, which when clicked will toggle the button text between "hello" and "world". It will also update the search params to include the value, which means that after refreshing the page, the state will be preserved.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { useObserveAndStore } from "@sp-hooks/next";

const Component = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);

  useObserveAndStore({ darkMode });

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}>
      {darkMode ? "üåö" : "‚òÄÔ∏è"}
    </button>
  );
};
```
